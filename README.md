# eva-covez

A minimalist e-commerce blog on Project Management built with **Django**, **SQLite**,
**TailwindCSS**, and **Docker**.

This is a personal project developed for my sister as a presentation website for her work. It is not
meant to scale or be heavily trafficked, but to serve as a real-world reference for small-scale
deployment and modern development practices.

> ⚠️ This project is **open source**, but **not open for contributions**. It's public for reference
> — for myself and for others who might benefit from studying or adapting it for their own ideas.
